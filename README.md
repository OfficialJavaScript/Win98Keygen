# Win98Keygen
A Python Tool that creates Windows 98 Keys (This is still in beta and has not been tested yet.)

# How was this tool created?
I started coding this project myself alongside a little Copilot then got stuck with the 3rd section of the code (Due to the dividing sum stuff.)

# What gave me the idea?
Well I watched a video by Enderman (https://www.youtube.com/@Endermanch)

Please go and give him some support, he is also the creator of many cool projects so really please go and check him out: https://github.com/Endermanch

# Do the given keys work?
I have no idea at this moment in time - I haven't had the time to spin up a VM and check (I am drowning in schoolwork ðŸ˜«)
